        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Undergraduate student interested in the Ethics of Computer Science revolving around Art and Cybersecurity</p>
        
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>Queen Mary University of London - Computer Science and AI BSc Sep 2024 - May 2028</p>
 
        <h3>Skills</h3>

        <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
        <h2>The effect of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Concept Art and further implications it has on current society. Sep 2022 - Jun 2023</h2>
        <p>In this project I researched the ethics of Generative AI usage when it comes to art. I used referenced scholarship to back up my analysis and undertook my own experiment comparing human vs AI art creating my own digital art in the process. This project was awarded a distinction and forwarded to be externally marked.</p>
        
        <h2>Is artificial intelligence a benefit or detriment to society? July 2023-Aug 2023</h2>
        <p>As part of an essay prize, I chose to write on how AI will affect society in the future in 550. In the essay I highlighted how crucial AI is already to medical technology while also acknowledging its lack of precision in its results. The essay also touches on creating ethical frameworks to ensure that AI does not evolve into a tool which negatively impacts society.</p>
        
        <h2>Text RPG Project (Python- Object Oriented Program) | Jun 2023 - Sept 2023</h2>
        <p>To further better my understanding of OOP I created a text-based RPG based off games I enjoy. The game consisted of a maze with rooms, items found in the rooms could be picked up, dropped. It also had a mechanism to fight enemies in combat and receive certain power ups depending on the item the user held during the fight.</p>
        
        <h2> Mythical Creature Care Program Project (Java - Procedural Programming) | Sept 2024 present</h2>
        <p>My current project focuses on using ADTs, loops and file input output to create a text-based game. The game allows users to enter as many creatures as they want and feed them different foods. Using the file input output it can save the users input to be loaded in the next time the game is run.</p>
