                    This project is a fun care program where you the player can create, store and feed your mythical pets!
                    The project was created to focus on the use of ADTs and file input output in Java

                    As a way to futher my understanding of OOP I created a text-based RPG where the user can traverse througha map to collect items to defeat enemies along the way.

                    <h4>The effect of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Concept Art and further implications it has on current 
                        society

                </figure>

                <p>
                    In this research project I explored the ethics of Generative AI usage when it comes to art and the implications it has on artists and its the way it coudl cause job insecurity for artists.
                    I used scholaship to support my analysis and undertook and experiment by comparing my own concept art vs that of an AI generated one with the same prompt.
                    This project was awarded a distinction and was forwarded to be externally marked.

                    I undertook this research as part of an essay prize in which I decided to write on how AI will affect society in the future.
                    It highlighted the benefits and detriments of AI and touched on the creation ethical frameworks to ensure that AI remains a tool that benefits society.
